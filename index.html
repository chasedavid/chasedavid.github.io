    <h3>My Bio</h3>
    <p>
        My life of excitement begins (like most other people) when I was born. Born in the swanky city of San Diego.
        Unfortunatley, I like most others would only know this town as a vacation destination. Instead, I grew into
        a man in the Suburbs of Phoenix Arizona. A strange hodge-podge of farm land and neighborhoods. As time progressed
        the farms were consumed in housing to fuel the fast growing area. It was here I learned to love the outdoors,
        I learned I loved to travel, and learned that I loved math.
    </p>

        I learned I loved math my senior year of high school. The combination of statistics and calculus brought purpose 
        to the many algebra rules the teachers had been telling me to just memorize and resite. The applications and insite
        fueled a love - a love that would take me to Arizona State University to study applied mathematics.
